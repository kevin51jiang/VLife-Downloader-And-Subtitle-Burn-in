# VLife-Downloader-And-Subtitle-Burn-in
Welp. I'm lazy, and I just became a koreaboo. Time to combine the two.

## Roadmap
1. Make python script
2. Use youtube-dl to download relevant videos
3. Use youtube-dl to download relevant subtitles
4. Use VLC CLI to burn in the subtitles
5. Maybe add an automatic youtube/dailymotion uploader?
